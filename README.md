# Attendance-to-Payslip-Program
A template that converts the monthly attendance of every employee into their payslips

I wrote this template in Microsoft Excel back in March 2021 when I was working.
Its features include:
- Automatically display/hide dates based on month selected (like Feb 2020 will have 29 days, Feb 2021 28 days, March 31 days etc.)
- Automatically update weekdays based on date (like 1 March 2021 is Monday, while 1 March 2022 is Wednesday)
- Automatically display the working shift (with respective background colors), working hours, OT hours, whether is an employee late, and reasons of absence based on the attendance. It even takes public holidays into account.

It's simple to use and saves a lot of time in generating payslip.
Do note that I build this template based on the company's requirements.
It can be customized easily, and I have no problem building a new one to suit future requests.

How to use:
Step 1: Copy Column A to Column J from "Jan/Feb Attendance (Details Hidden).xlsx" file
Step 2: Paste that into the "Attendance" tab in the file named "Attendance to Pay Slip Template (Details Hidden).xlsx"
Step 3: Wait a few seconds for it to load, then go to the "PAY" tab and select the month.

Viola! Now you have the payslip.
You may also select the 2 "Jan/Feb 2021 Pay Slip.xlsx" files to directly see the output.
